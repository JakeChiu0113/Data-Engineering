## Working on Machine Learning Projects

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Feature Engineering
5. Explore different models and shortlist the best ones
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
